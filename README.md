# Hopfield Networks
Implementation and Analysis of Hopfield Networks in Python.

Hopfield Networks are based on the idea of "associate" (content-addressable) memory and often compared to human's associative memory.
(All information was taken from Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopfield_network)

Here I trained and tested Hopfield Networks on handwritten digits and on digits from MNIST (randomly selected subset).
Different training sets yielded different results.
